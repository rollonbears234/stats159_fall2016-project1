# Abstract for Project 1 for Stats 159

The first project should demonstrate my understanding of the materials in class so far, specifically I will be *writing about writing*.

We have learned to use the following tools so far:
1. bash
2. markdown
3. pandoc
4. git
5. github
6. Make
7. a text editor


#### Instructions for the assignment

> If it helps, pretend that you have to write a blog post about using the tools weâ€™ve seen so far, explaining the role they play. Imagine that the target audience are other undergrad students in statistics (or similar fields). Keep in mind that the paper you write may become a tutorial: a document that you may read later in the future in order to remember how you did something
(e.g. write a Makefile).
