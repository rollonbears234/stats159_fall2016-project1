Git is a version control system, much like subversion. It helps keep track of changes in code. It does so by keeping track of only the changes, this way we avoid having to duplicate files if there are changes, which has a lot of overhead due to redundancy. Git tracks the changes and assigns an ID to every commit.

Some useful properties of git are the ability to backtrack to older versions (checkout).

Also, branches are helpful. When coding, two different tracks can be taken to see which one works the best, when one branch works better than the other, a simple merge can add that feature into the main code.
